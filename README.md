Contact Section:
The contact form allows visitors to reach out to me. It includes basic fields for name, email, and message. The form is integrated with a static submission service, such as Formspree, for processing.

Technical Requirements
HTML:
The portfolio is structured using HTML5 semantic tags:

<header>, <section>, <footer>, etc. This ensures the content is properly organized and accessible.
CSS:
Custom CSS styles are applied to the portfolio for both visual appeal and responsiveness. The layout is designed to adapt to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop). A simple CSS animation has been included for interactive hover effects and transitions.

JavaScript:
Interactivity is added using JavaScript. Here are a few examples of how JavaScript is utilized:

A modal window to display additional information about the projects.
A carousel that rotates through project screenshots in the Projects section.
Form validation for the contact form to ensure the fields are properly filled before submission.
Frontend Framework (Optional):
Although optional, a CSS framework such as Bootstrap or Tailwind was used (depending on your choice) for simplified responsive design. You could also opt to use a JavaScript framework like Vue.js for dynamic content rendering, but this isn't mandatory.
